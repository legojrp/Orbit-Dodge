# How to Play
### Controls

**D** / **->**    -- Right

##### Physics:
It is not a mistake that if you travel at a high speed, and stop pressing the button, that you continue at that speed. This is to emulate a full space experience by Newton's 1st law.

### Gameplay
#### The Goal
The Goal of the game is to get the highest score by dodgeing asteroids and keep your crew alive. Asteroids are very slow at the beginning and may take up to 20 seconds to start appearing. That is because the asteroids are coming at different angles, at a slow speed. Don't be confident, as more will follow the slow asteroids quickly.
#### The UI
Has three parts: the controls, the speed and danger of dying indicator, and the score counter.
##### Controls
 These controls are for mobile use
##### Speed and Danger of Dying Indicator
The speed indicator is telling you your speed. Your speed may never reach above 1 m/s, otherwise your orbital path will be too strayed from the plan, and your crew wil die. The Danger of Dying Indicator is telling based on color your distance from straying too far, and the speed. If you stray too far, your capsule will no longer be visible on the screen.
* Green: Your relative speed and distance are fine.
* Yellow: Proceed with caution, as your speed or distance may be getting close to death.
* Red: Stop dodging activity if possible to maintain a safe speed and distance.
